Plot types: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \acrshort{ssim} and \acrshort{mse} changes during training.
    \item Loss function evolution.
    \item Line plot of gt, ns, and different loss functions?
    \item Histograms of gt, ns, denoised
    \item Zoomed in region of interest.
    \item Axial, sagittal, and coronal plots of (at least Kim Robert's dataset) different depth parameters.
    \item Compare denoising of different subsamplings (8, 16, 32, 48) (and poisson noise / shot noise?)
    \item Activation plot of network layers.
\end{itemize}
