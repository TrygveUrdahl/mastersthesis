\chapter*{Preface}
This master's thesis is written to fulfill the requirements of the Master of Science (M.Sc.) program \textit{Applied Physics and Mathematics} at the \NTNU (NTNU). It concludes a five year study program with a specialization in engineering physics. 

The work of this thesis was performed during the spring semester of 2021. I have had the pleasure of working with the X-ray group at the Department of Physics at NTNU and PoreLab throughout the semester. 

I would like to thank my supervisor Basab Chattopadhyay for providing this exciting project, as well as guiding me through it. His help and willingness to let me form the project to my interests have made this a very enjoyable semester.

Additionally, a big thank you goes to Fredrik K. Mürer for his input and feedback throughout the semester, especially during the final stretch. The comments he has given me have certainly improved the quality of this thesis. To PhD candidate Kim Robert Bjørk Tekseth, I would like to express my gratitude for providing an exciting dataset and fruitful discussions of my results. 

Finally, I have to thank my friends who have listened to me blabber on about this project throughout the entirety of the semester. I have enjoyed annoying you all!
