\chapter*{Preface}
This master's thesis is written to fulfill the requirements of the Master of Science (M.Sc.) program \textit{Applied Physics and Mathematics} at the \NTNU (NTNU). It concludes a five year study program with a specialization in engineering physics. 

The work of this thesis was performed during the spring semester of 2021. I have had the pleasure of working with the X-ray group at the Department of Physics at NTNU and PoreLab throughout the semester.
