\todo[inline]{Network performs well, however without depth it does not properly capture 3D information. It is just denoising separate images then (which can be used for many other cases than \acrshort{ct} denoising). }

\section{Further Work}
\todo[inline]{Experiment with changing the structure of the network (e.g. depth of network, or use of 3D convolutions). Currently there is an obvious favored dimension (axial per-slice) in the denoising. }
\todo[inline]{TomoGAN with depth 1 can be used to denoise, and generally transform, other images than \acrshort{ct} images. Would be interesting to see other image processing tasks tackled.}
